This project investigates the World Bank - World Development Indicators to answer a major question: Is primary school enrollment linked to labor force participation and unemployment in low-, middle-, and high-income countries across genders?

Each year, the World Bank updates their World Development Indicators, a dataset that spans over 217 economies measuring key indicators that allow analysis on the world scale. Insights are thematically based and include: poverty & inequality, people, environment, economy, states and markets, global links amongst others. This project investigates a niche area, merging the topics of youth labor, unemployment, gender equity and school enrollment, and its effects on poverty. We selected these variables because they intersect in ways that are critical for understanding how systemic inequalities affect social development and poverty alleviation efforts.
