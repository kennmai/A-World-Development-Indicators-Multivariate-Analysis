Our project leverages the World Bank - World Development Indicators Dataset to consider a major question: Are social development challenges and poverty linked across various countries over the last decade (2013-2023)?

Each year, the World Bank updates their World Development Indicators, a dataset that spans over 217 economies measuring key indicators that allow analysis on the world scale. Insights are thematically based and include: poverty & inequality, people, environment, economy, states and markets, global links amongst others. This project investigates a niche area, merging the topics of youth labor, unemployment, gender equity and school enrollment, and its effects on poverty. We selected these variables because they intersect in ways that are critical for understanding how systemic inequalities affect social development and poverty alleviation efforts.
